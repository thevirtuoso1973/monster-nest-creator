# Monster Nest

1. Build monsters during day - use arrow keys to select parts
2. Humans attack during night - sit back and watch the humans and monsters duke it out, or use the LMB to help the monsters run away. If you survive long enough or kill the humans, you'll survive that night.
3. Survive 5 nights = win

The stats for each monster part is fixed, but the human stats are (mostly) random.

# Building/Compiling the Game

You may need to do this if I have not uploaded the binaries/executables for some reason.

Just get Rust and run `cargo run --release` in the project root.
